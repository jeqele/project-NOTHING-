# project-NOTHING

# In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and what was the material? Actually everything is created from nothing, you can find it in Hebrew Bible, The Bible and Quran.

 

# In computer sciences, "nothing" is known as NULL or "\0"

# So, I created a python script to convert "nothing" into a PNG formatted image.

# This image is not visual, it is just a concept.

# The concept is that I have patented "nothing" as a non-fungible token (nft).

 

# "Nothing" is part of everything.

# So if I have "nothing" 's copyright,  actually everything is mine.
